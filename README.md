# smartwrks tech test


## Personal Git Repo:  ** caroleatierney.github.io **

## Link to Form:  *https://caroleatierney.github.io/smartwrks/*

Notes about the form: I added some button logic. After the next button (submit)
the user can click on the cancel or save and close buttons. (It doesn't actually save, but the message says it does. If there are no errors the form will appear to have been submitted, if there are errors they will be displayed accordingly.)

## Algorithms are both in the app.js file
I console logged the results
- [x] fizzbuzz
- [x] duplicate numbers
